# Advertising campaigns Manager project

Welcome!

This project is an attempt to deepen my understanding of JavaFX while exploring generics and object-oriented programming in a more professional context.

The application simulates a professional software environment by requiring user authentication and providing access to profile-related information, such as the advertising campaigns you have created or are currently working on. Within the software, you can manage advertising campaigns by adding different types of advertisements, sorting them by type, name, or date, all within a graphical interface.

âš  Work in Progress: This project is still under development.
